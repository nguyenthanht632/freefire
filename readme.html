I love cookies big and small, I love cookies I love them all. Do you have cookies? Do you need them eaten? If so, me the monster for the job.

Flavors of expertise: chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, maple leaf cookies - and while you were reading I just ate your browser cookies...om nom nom nom.

My favorite word? Cookie! My least favorite word? "outofcookies". Me have over 30 years of experience with cookies on Sesame Street. And if you want to see me in action please watch my SNL demo reel where I act, sing and eat cookies.
